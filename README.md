# Media Notes Web Archive

## Overview

A website utalizing PostgreSQL, and Node to list a selection of book, tv, and movie watchlists.
It also supports adding notes for each entry and rating them.

## Objectives

Uses a PostgreSQL database to store information gained from two independent publicly available APIs on books, movies, or television shows. The user can add their own notes about works that they add to their "library."

## Future Plans

Create a functional user account system, so that multiple users can authenticate their interactions with the website and use it at the same time.

## APIs Used

The following APIs were used to make this project work; links to them and about how to make use them are as follows:

- [Open Library Covers API](https://openlibrary.org/dev/docs/)
- [IMDB API](https://imdbapi.dev/)
